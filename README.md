# Event Planner - Polymer
This repository contains all my own programming project files, notes, and associated files for the [Udacity -Senior Web Developer Nanodegree - By Google - Project 1](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

## Project Criteria
This application was created as an Event Planner, with a special focus on form validation, and application responsive display on all devices. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.

### Additional Features
- Home-screen installable.
- Google places address autocomplete.
- Firebase JSON data get / post. 
- Firebase Authentication user login / account creation.
- Basic offline functionality.
